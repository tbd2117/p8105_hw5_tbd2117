``` r
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.color = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

### Problem 1

Loading homicide data, adjusting `report_date` variable, and creating
`city_state` variable

``` r
homicide = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  separate(reported_date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = c(4, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>% 
  filter(!city_state == "Tulsa, AL") # n = 1, probable input error
```

The **homicide** dataset has 52178 rows and 15 columns with data on
homicides in 50 large U.S. cities gathered by the *Washington Post* from
2007 to 2017.

Creating variables to count total and unsolved homicides.

``` r
homicide_city = 
  homicide %>% 
    group_by(city_state) %>%
    summarise(
      total_homicides = n(),
      unsolved_homicides = 
        sum(
          str_count(disposition, "Closed without arrest"), 
          str_count(disposition, "Open/No arrest")
        )
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Baltimore, MD estimated proportion (95%CI) of unsolved homicides:

``` r
prop.test(
  homicide_city %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(unsolved_homicides),
   homicide_city %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(total_homicides)
) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

Iterating for all cities:

``` r
city_results = 
homicide_city %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = unsolved_homicides, .y = total_homicides, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_test) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Plotting estimates and CIs for each city:

``` r
city_results %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, desc(estimate))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
  labs(
    x = "City, State",
    y = "Estimated Proportion of \n Unsolved Homicides (95%CI)"
  )
```
